# A carousel extension for the NeosRulez.Bootstrap Gallery

## Installation

The NeosRulez.Bootstrap.GalleryCarousel package is listed on packagist (https://packagist.org/packages/neosrulez/bootstrap-gallerycarousel) - therefore you don't have to include the package in your "repositories" entry any more.

Just run:

```
composer require neosrulez/bootstrap-gallerycarousel
```
